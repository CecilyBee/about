# Current goals

## Awesome open-source code search

## 3x pipeline coverage

> **Outcome:** Maintain a 3x ratio of (weighted pipeline with close date in the next 90 days) to (company sales plan in the next 90 days).

> **Status:** TBD TODO(ericbm): make a dashboard to measure this

Our pipeline is our future opportunities to earn revenue from new and existing customers. We want to maintain a healthy pipeline coverage ratio so we have greater confidence that we'll meet and exceed our future targets. Predictable revenue lets us make bigger long-term investments in our team and product, which is a virtuous cycle.

(Why choose pipeline, not revenue, as the goal? Revenue is a lagging indicator. Something you do today (such as shipping a new feature or making new people aware of Sourcegraph) can show up in pipeline within hours or days if it generates interest from a prospect, but it may take weeks or months to turn into a signed deal and actual revenue. As long as our sales team is rigorous about measuring pipeline, everyone else can rely on the pipeline abstraction for their own goal-setting.)

## Show convincing org-wide value faster

> **Outcome:** By 2020-08-14, total pipeline (weighted, closing within 3 months) where the value prop is org-wide and not dependent on devs just using code search individually.

We need to demonstrate org-wide (not just individual developer) value quickly and repeatably with features such as campaigns, code insights, and security/compliance). We also need to communicate that value to the buyer. These will help us earn customers faster (which means our champions spend less time wrangling internal buying processes) and solve bigger problems for customers.

Right now, the value of Sourcegraph to an organization is roughly proportional to the number of people using it. This means that value grows gradually, because it takes time for usage to spread. But if a single person can use it for organization-wide tasks (such as those that save time or fix problems for many people at once), we can show much greater value much faster.
 
Many Sourcegraph power users would say their individual usage of our code search is already valuable organization-wide. But this kind of argument isn't helpful for earning us a customer quickly because it takes time for a power user to gain that level of confidence. It also usually involves citing many specific, unrelated use cases for search, which makes the overall value prop complex---and slightly different for each organization.
