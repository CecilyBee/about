<!-- START SUMMARY -->
In this podcast, [Quinn Slack](https://slack.org) (Sourcegraph CEO/cofounder) and [Beyang Liu](http://beyang.org) (Sourcegraph CTO/cofounder) walk through a recent Sourcegraph board meeting's slides. If you've ever wondered what startup board meetings are really like, or how we as founders work with our board, this episode is for you. In addition to sharing what's on the slides, we talk about:

- Why we never sugarcoat anything for the board
- Why it's usually bad to do extra work just for a board meeting
- Our first 2 slides in every board meeting ("Bad & good" lists, and how we're addressing the #1 bad thing)
- Why we present top 10 lists for new bookings and pipeline
- Reaffirming the latest messaging and pitches with board members
- Why we share all board slides with all Sourcegraph team members from the moment when we start creating them

<!-- START TRANSCRIPT -->
**Quinn Slack:** Hey, I'm Quinn Slack, CEO and cofounder of Sourcegraph. I'm here with my Beyang Liu, who's our CTO and cofounder. We thought we'd do something a little different today. Instead of interviewing guests from outside of Sourcegraph, we would just show what goes on inside of Sourcegraph.

Maybe you are a developer who's thinking of starting a company in the future. Maybe you're at a company and you just wonder what our board meetings are like. So, we're just going to run through what our most recent board meeting was like.

This was from a couple days ago. It's really fresh in our minds, and our hope here is that it just shows off some of the magic and mystery behind the scenes, the kind of things that a lot of companies keep secret.

At Sourcegraph, we are pretty transparent internally about board stuff, and we're trying to be more transparent with folks outside the company, too.

Beyang, anything I missed?

**Beyang Liu:** No, I think you did a good job of giving an overview. I'm just excited to kind of show people what it's like a bit under the hood and on the business side of Sourcegraph.

**Quinn:** You can see the [slides in the show notes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12Y1txpWfMzoAr_HluXm6cMDGX8cSy35F31HEwomEnjU/edit) for this episode. We have taken out some sensitive things. Our customers trust us to not release kinds of stuff, obviously. So we're going to keep this as detailed as we can, but not reveal any truly sensitive things.

Before we begin, Beyang and I have a philosophy about the board, which is they are here to help us. Our board consists of some fantastic investors that have put money into Sourcegraph has spent a lot of time helping us build Sourcegraph and we feel really lucky to have them. We never try to sugarcoat things to the board because, in a way, they entrusted us with their money and the only way that they can get that out is through Sourcegraph being successful. And so we optimize for that long term success even if there are some bumps along the way when things aren't going well. And no matter how well things are going, there's always stuff that we can get better at.

So we never try to sugarcoat stuff for the board. When a new person joins the team and is going to their first board meeting, I always make sure to communicate this so that people don't think that they have to juggle both the internal version of the story and the board story (how we describe something to the board). The board is most helpful when we present them with the actual things that we're thinking about.

If we ever feel like we're doing extra work for the board that is not actually in service of the business, then that's a red flag for two reasons. One, it's waste of time. Two, it gives the board a false sense of what we are actually spending our time on.

**Beyang:** Yeah, and also just take a step back, you know, the purpose of a board meeting is really to kind of get feedback from a set of individuals who have a unique perspective on the business side. They've seen a lot of startups before, they've seen a lot of businesses before, and they can offer a unique insight that we wouldn't just get day-to-day in the internal operations of the business. This is all in service of our ultimate mission at Sourcegraph, which is to make it possible for everyone to code and everyone to make a living off of code.

As part of that mission, we have to build a sustainable business. And we need to control our own destiny. These board meetings are regular check ins, where we convey the latest that has happened at the company to the board and we get advice and input from the board about things they think we could do differently or improve or other things to look out for.

**Quinn:** All right, let's get into it. We like to always start out with a slide that is entitled "Bad and good."

We put bad first because, with the good stuff, sure, it's nice to pat ourselves on the back to recognize success, but we're working (and should be working) to improve the the bad stuff. That's what we want the board's help on.

No matter how well things are going, we don't want to spend time patting ourselves on the back. There's a lot of people out there that don't code or can't make a living on code or that need help coding, so we are a tiny fraction of the way to fulfilling our mission.

So, right now for us as a business. It's August 19, 2020, for those historians out there. We are about six months into the Covid-19 pandemic. We have seen the overall economy split into two. There's a lot of software companies out there that are more needed than ever, and we're very fortunate that many of those are our customers. We're working really hard to be there to serve them.

We really started going to market in the last year and a half. We've started to see nice repeatability in our sales process. First, a developer finds out about code search and Sourcegraph. They say, "Wow, I love this! I love it so much. I want to be using it at work, because that's where I spend most of my time coding." And so they bring Sourcegraph into their company. They share it with their teammates. It takes off. And at a certain point they want to get it rolled out to their whole company. That means getting either the Team or Enterprise package. And that's basically our sales process. We've seen this happen many times now, and it's getting more and more repeatable.

As a company, we're growing in many ways: our team, our sales, and our customer base. And we're making sure we are there for our customers.

Here's one thing that I find really cool: the concept of the sales pipeline. I'm a developer and have been all of my life. I don't come from a sales background per se. But this notion of pipeline as implemented by modern sales teams is really cool.

Sales teams have gotten very good about being rigorous with the pipeline. It's the central thing that the sales team is oriented around. Pipeline solves the following problem. You want to know how you can grow your company. That means growing revenue. But revenue is a lagging indicator: work that you do today to help get a customer won't actually turn into revenue for (possibly) many months. You do something today to help a company learn about your product one month from now, then it takes 3 months for usage to spread within taht company, and then another 2 months to actually go through the buying process. If you're just looking at revenue, it might be six months until you see any signs that what you did today was valuable!

Pipeline is an abstraction. It's a model to pull that revenue forward so that you can see, for work that you do today, what impact does it have on the company's success? With pipeline, you can say "I fixed a bug today. That meant that a company that had 5 users on our product was able to get another 5 users on." Because of that, they are now in a slightly later stage and pipeline, because we can know from historical data that once there's 10 users on, they're 10 percentage points more likely to become a customer. You have an estimate of the deal size, and so you can quantify the value of adding 10 percentage points of likelihood. That's a amount of dollars today that you probabilistically earned!

Of course, not even pipeline is always so instantly measurable. It doesn't always show up the next day. But it's certainly much faster than months out like revenue.

For us as a business, we're looking at our pipeline and it's grown a lot. Our pipeline in the near term is looking really strong. There's a lot of awesome companies that have Sourcegraph rolled out enterprise-wide or that are using it for something like a central security team. For a lot of these companies, for them to not end up buying Sourcegraph means a lot of developers would be very upset. Generally companies don't like to upset tons of their developers.

But looking at many more quarters in the future, we don't have that much visibility. That's the key "bad" thing we are working on. The companies in our pipeline discover Sourcegraph in all kinds of different ways. Some of them have found out about us on Twitter. Some of them found out about us from word of mouth. Some of them had an employee who previously worked at a company where everyone uses Sourcegraph, and they got to the new company and upon realizing the new company didn't use Sourcegraph, said, "How do people even write code here without code search?" and then brought Sourcegraph in.

Anyway, companies get in our pipeline for a variety of reasons. It would be nice, in a hypothetical way, if all of our customers came from a single source (such as Google ads). We could just spend more on Google ads and then we get more customers. Boom! Simple! I mean, it's obviously never that simple.

But we're on the other extreme of that. It's all word of mouth--developer word of mouth. And that's something that is very difficult to scale. Our main challenge right now is: how do we make it so more developers know about code search and Sourcegraph, try our product, love it, and use it inside of their company. That's going to give us more predictable pipeline and also visibility further out in our pipeline.

**Beyang:** I think the two most important things with with with respect to pipeline are: one, that your business grows along with pipeline; and two, it's useful to get better at predicting what what future sales will look like. A lot of growing a business from inception to maturity is about de-risking things. Once you become a mature business, you really want to be able to convey certainty to all the different stakeholders inside your company about what the future looks like.

**Quinn:** The other "bad" thing that we've highlighted to the board is caused by our fast growth in the last couple of months. We went from around 40 team members to 56. We have to be more deliberate about things like onboarding new teammates, both in the company-wide systems and processes, and also maintaining each individual team's culture and responsibility of ownership. Also cross-team communication.

**Beyang:** One of the challenges here is that as you grow and add more people, a certain amount of process becomes necessary because you have more moving parts, more independent minds at work. But at the same time, you want to harness the new people's new ideas and preserve space for individuals to spearhead new innovative efforts that could become the zero-to-one projects or opportunities that lead to whole new products in the future. So that's something that we think about a lot, especially as we scale the engineering and product team.

**Quinn:** Yeah, we need the right mix of consistent progress *and* crazy ideas that end up being 100 times better than anything that could have been achieved by just consistent progress. It's hard to balance those, but doing it well has huge rewards.

All right, so let's go back to the board slides. We talked about the "Bad and good." Our business is doing really well right now. But again, we don't want to pat ourselves on the back. I always want to jump into how we are solving those bad things. So the next slide is just that: how and when will we scale our pipeline?

There's a tendency as the business grows to want to look at everything in a detached away and say, "Well, the way that we're going to solve this business problem is by stepping back and getting the right plan in place and hiring the right people and the right functions and giving them responsibilities. Blah blah blah." That's true. But I think that's too detached when something is the most important thing that you need to solve in the business. There's always things that you can be doing right now. any plan that's having you wait many months to see if your intended solution is real is a huge red flag.

So, we list some specific things that we are doing right now. And one is what I talked about around increasing awareness among developers. Even things like getting posts a single post on Hacker News would massively increase awareness of Sourcegraph. There's a lot of low hanging fruit that we see.

There's also what I also touched on earlier, which is getting in touch with those people that were using Sourcegraph all the time of their previous company and just moved to a new company. That's been a tremendous source of new companies using Sourcegraph. We can go find those people--and in many cases, we already know those people and they would love to hear from us!

And then finally, we have customers and investors and friends who have always offered to make warm intros for us. For example, to tell their friend over at some other company, "Hey, this Sourcegraph is really cool." In the past, we weren't actually that good at doing much with those leads because we focused on doing well when someone was already using Sourcegraph for their company. But if someone was totally brand new to code search and had no idea why it was valuable, that's harder. But recently we've got a lot better a turning these warm intros into a company that actually has interest in Sourcegraph. We've gone through the exercise of figuring out and writing down really concretely, for the big companies using Sourcegraph, how do they internally think of the value they get from Sourcegraph. It's not, "We can search our code." It's things like "We can onboard everyone faster. We can improve developer efficiency by X%. We can find and fix a security problem in way less time." Those are things that you can talk about when someone is skeptical of code search or just doesn't even know what it means. And we can also say, "Here are the companies that are using Sourcegraph," and back it up with case studies

One thing I wish we had done earlier, before we got good at handling these warm intros, is to tell investors that we didn't want them. They were certainly trying to be helpful, but we should have just told them, "No thanks. We've learned we only do well when a company is already using Sourcegraph." And that's OK. But it's good we've gotten better at warm intros since then.

**Beyang:** We're all super passionate about Sourcegraph and spreading Sourcegraph to as many people as we possibly can, because we think that the more people use it, the more people get value out of it. And the greater positive impact we have on the world.

While doing that, we also want to be mindful that the way we reach out to new potential users and members is really thoughtful and authentic. There's always this tension, because as you know people always think their own product is great, but it can be annoying to be on the receiving end of that. If you ever see anything from Sourcegraph that you feel is annoying, not valuable, or not compelling, let us know. It means we messed up.


**Quinn:** One example is I've got friends that are at companies where they're not yet using Sourcegraph. And they say, "Hey, Quinn. Can you send me a message that I could post in our Slack or that I could pass along to the person who runs dev tools at my company?" But we've found that's actually not the right first way for those people to come into contact with Sourcegraph.

What I find way more valuable is to understand what kind of interesting blog post, for example, could we have posted that would have organically been interesting and compelling to those people, so they would have discovered it organically without this kind of forced feeling of, "Here's a message from the Sourcegraph CEO about why you should use their product" that that just doesn't feel right.

We want to do things that are truly compelling to developers. That's what is right, and it's what's most effective.

**Beyang:** Especially in the early days, my advice toother developer tool founders is: rely on your own intuition here. Don't let a so-called expert in startup marketing or whatever talk you into doing something that runs counter to your intuition. There's always this tendency, especially if you're a first-time founder to say, "I don't really know. That's not my area of expertise. So I'm going to ask someone what should a generic startup be doing in my shoes." But there's no there's no such thing as a generic business, so when you get advice from other people, especially domain experts, you always need to filter that through your own intuition and remain authentic to what you're trying to convey and build. There's just no way to outsource that.

**Quinn:** Yeah, you probably can get to your first $1M or $1.5M in ARR (annual recurring revenue) with just the mindset that you're developer working with other developers and doing things that are truly compelling to them. (Obviously, it's assuming you're in the you're selling product for developers.)

All right, going back to the board slides.

We always like to make sure the board walks out of the meeting having the absolute latest way to describe and pitch Sourcegraph. This should always be what's on our homepage. If our homepage ever lags behind what we find to be the most effective pitch for Sourcegraph, then that's a huge failure. So, in the slides, we show off our new marketing site.

For us, the best way to describe Sourcegraph is: universal code search and "Move fast, even in big codebases."

And then we about the product in every single board meeting, There's a temptation to just report on sales to the board. But I want to include the product because in the end, everything we do comes from the product and if all we talk about is internal things like sales, it feels like it loses the heart and spirit of the company.

I've also been including some fun user quotes--both positive and negative. "I can't live without it." Someone wrote, "Mr. Slack, you built a beautiful service. I wanted to share this uplifting information with you." Very nice. And: "get rid of that stupid regexp for repo" and "the technology is cool but the theme is (very bad)."

This gives the board a pulse on what kind of feedback we're seeing. We get tons of feedback, which is awesome.

Next we run through company vitals. We show historical total ARR (annual recurring revenue), which is the key revenue metric that we track. We show our cash on hand. We also show our monthly profit/burn and our team size. All of these are also regularly reported on to our team.

From here we cover the sales pipeline and sales results. The way that we format these slides is based on advice that I got from David Sacks of Craft Ventures (who's on our board).

We first show the top 10 bookings since the last board meeting. (A booking is any kind of transaction that resulted in a customer paying us money, usually ARR.) Top 10 is a really good way to do it because when you choose the top 10, your choice of what's in the top 10 is informative. It's not necessarily top 10 largest deals. It's whatever you consider most important, so you're also telling the board how you decide which ones are the most important

There's a story behind each of them that communicates way more than some overall number or a boring list of all of them by date. It's also much easier to talk through because you know there's 10 instead of 50 or whatever.

Then we'll do the same for our pipeline. We split our pipeline into "new customers" (organizations that have never paid us before) and "expansion" (when we earn more business from an existing customer). We show our new customer pipeline--again, top 10, not necessarily things closing in the next three months, just what are the top 10 that we think are most important for the future of the business.

A lot of questions will be asked here. "Why is this one higher than the other one?" "Why do we feel like this one is actually going to close?" We do a pipeline review every single week with our team, so we're really used to this kind of inspection of the pipeline.

Again, going back to our love of the sales pipeline as developers. I've loved learning about this really rigorous take on pipeline. It's as though for developers, if you went through all of your issues each week, and had a really rigorous conversation about the progress on each issue and the relevance. It takes a lot of discipline, but there's a ton of value in it.

I sometimes wonder what it would look like if sales became a little bit more like engineering, and if engineering became a little bit more like sales. We're definitely trying to have some of that cross-pollination of ideas and practices here at Sourcegraph.

We also always have a followup slide to see, of all the stuff that we were projecting at the last board meeting, what actually end up happening and if there were any surprises.

That's the bulk of the board meeting. From there it's whatever other topics are important.

In this past board meeting, we summarized our growth in team (which roles) and expenses, and how we're projecting that into the future.

We talked about our marketing plan, and how we're building up an Operations team: Sales Ops, Business Ops, People Ops, and so on. And then we talked about how we see the competition out there for our business.

These are all things that are on our mind. When thinking about what topics should go in the board meeting, I think about what we've been talking about as a team. What are we actually spending our time thinking about?

By the way, as we're building the slides for a board meeting, they're all visible to every single person at the company, on our Google Drive.

One funny thing I see is that a lot of people on the team, when they're new, they expect that there's a lot of new things--a lot of surprises--from the board meeting. But a good board meeting is one with no surprises for anyone. The team should know everything that we're talking about at the board meeting, because the team is the ones who have helped us figure out the strategy and execute on it.

I preview the board slides in advance of the board meeting with each board member individually. We walk them through the board slides, we get their feedback, and we get their questions. We'll tweak things a lot beforehand in response to that feedback. This lets us focus on the important discussion topics instead of having board members saying, "What does that metric mean?" or "Whoa, I wasn't expecting that!" We want to remove surprises, so that we can focus our discussion on getting their input on the tough and interesting issues.

**Beyang:** Transparency is very important to us because it's a crucial complement to agency. Agency is the ability of any individual at your company to see the end-to-end picture and propose/execute on good ideas that they want to see brought into existence. You can't really have agency without transparency, because if you don't have transparency, any given person on your team doesn't have all the information they need to make an informed decision. So, what ends up happening is they just become more passive--they rely on someone else, maybe someone "higher up the food chain" to go and tell them what to do. And that just means you're not getting all you can out of the really excellent people that you've hired. It means that there's kind of this diffusion of responsibility for critical thinking and decision-making. Poor decisions are made, and there's a longer feedback loop to discover whether those decisions are really good or bad.

And it looks like we're gonna have to cut this off now...

**Quinn:** I gotta cut this off. It's time for my grandma to talk to my daughter on FaceTime.

We would love to hear your feedback on this episode. If people find these interesting, we'll do more of these in the future. Thanks for listening!
