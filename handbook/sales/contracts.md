# Contracts

Sourcegraph's [Free and Team tiers](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing) do not allow for custom contract negotiations. Rather, they use our default [Terms of Service for Private and Self-hosted Sourcegraph Instances](https://about.sourcegraph.com/terms-private).

Sourcegraph's [Enterprise tier](https://about.sourcegraph.com/pricing) only allows for custom contract negotiations in certain circumstances.

- By default, these agreements use the Sourcegraph Enterprise License Agreement (Coming soon).
- For contracts with an annual contract value greater than $100,000, customers can negotiate custom terms

## Counsel

Sourcegraph does not have in-house counsel. Rather, ask [@Dan](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/team#dan-adler-he-him) for an introduction to our external counsel for contract review.

As soon as a deal that qualifies for custom terms reaches the [Contract Negotiation stage](index.md#Contract-Negotiation), we must check in with our external counsel to confirm that there are no conflicts in representation (i.e., that our lawyers don't also advise the potential customer, and if so, that the other side signs a waiver allowing the mutual representation). Notify [@Dan](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/team#dan-adler-he-him) as soon as possible to kick off this process.
