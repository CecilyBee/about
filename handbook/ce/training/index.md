# Training sessions

Every [Tier 1, 2, and 3](../../sales/index.md#segmentation) prospect and customer has the right to training session as part of their trial and contract. We find that training sessions are one of the best tools for making customers successful with Sourcegraph:

- They expose Sourcegraph to a larger group of initial users.
- They help with new user onbording, and making users aware of more advanced/non-obvious features.
- They remind users to come back to Sourcegraph to solve their problems during the critical early stages of a trial.
- They provide social proof of the value of Universal Code Search.

## Sessions

Training is presented in three sessions:

First, [**Sourcegraph 101**](session_1_sourcegraph_101.md), which teaches basic product functionality and introduces a few key use cases.

Second, [**Becoming a code search power user**](session_2_power_user.md), which teaches more advanced functinonality and use cases, and gives users the opportunity to share their own internal use cases.

Third, [**Sourcegraph roadmap and Q&A**](session_3_roadmap_qa), in which we present some upcoming featuers on our roadmap, and give users the opportunity to ask questions.
