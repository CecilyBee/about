# Production readiness: tracking

This page tracks the production readiness of all features in Sourcegraph. The aim is to communicate where we believe we're at, and where we believe we could improve, as a team.

[Learn more about production readiness](index.md).

Tracking a new or existing feature is as easy as adding a new section by copying the template at the bottom of this page.

Once all teams in a category (feature completeness, risk assessment, etc.) have OK'd a feature, then it gets a star. Remember - this is a cross-team-communication tool and nothing more.
