# Information security incident management

## Management of information security incidents and improvements

As a Software as a Service provider, Sourcegraph has developed and implemented extensive processes and procedures to manage and continuously improve Information Security Incidents.

## Responsibilities and procedures

Sourcegraph has established clear responsibilities and procedures throughout the organization for Incident Management. Sourcegraph operates a 24/7/365 virtual Operations Center with round-the-clock monitoring of Events for our own environment, and resources. 

Sourcegraph’s primary detective source of Event information is the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution that we operate. In addition to our procedural safeguards, the SIEM technology is configured to support the following service standards:

* Logs shall be reviewed by technologies that will consume and parse log data in real time and alert relevant operators of identified discrepancies and potential violations of applicable security policy and/or compromises to the organization’s security posture.

* All technologies, which consume, parse and review log data automatically shall be reviewed on a regular basis to ensure that the context of the log data accounts for events of interest that may have changed.

## Reporting Information Security events

Escalation procedures and timelines associated with Service Level Agreements explicitly detail communication protocols for reporting Information Security events, including instructions for further escalation in the event that primary contacts are unreachable.

## Reporting Information Security weaknesses

Employees and contractors using Sourcegraph’s information systems and services report any observed or suspected Information Security weaknesses in systems or services. The same principle applies to Information Security weaknesses that may be observed in customers’ environments.

##  Assessment of and decision on Information Security events

Sourcegraph assesses Security Events and has criteria for determining False Positive condition versus declaring an Incident for a wide variety of event types. These procedures are constantly updated as new events are seen for the first time, ensuring a continuous process of updating the Sourcegraph knowledge base and furthering the knowledge, skills, and experience of our staff.

## Response to Information Security Incidents

Sourcegraph has developed extensive knowledge for responding to Information Security Incidents. Sourcegraph leverages considerable experience in operations as well as industry best practice guidance including, but not limited to, NIST Special Publication 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide).

## Learning from Information Security incidents

Sourcegraph utilizes standard investigation and Incident Management processes, which always includes a post mortem following the resolution of a significant incident. This process allows Sourcegraph to learn from successes and adapt Security controls to enhance protection against future events – reducing the likelihood of future incidents.
