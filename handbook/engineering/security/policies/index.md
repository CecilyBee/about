# Sourcegraph Security Policies

## Overview

## Structure

### Applicability

Rules and parameters defined in this document apply to all processes, technologies, and activities undertaken by Sourcegraph staff - including full-time employees and/or appropriate third-party resources. These standards apply whether engaged directly in duties as part of the course of conducting other activities.

Not all processes and assets require the same level of control and attention when considering Information Security. As such a risk-based approach to policy application is employed, due to the following:

1. Neither all technology services, systems, nor individuals participate in the processing of sensitive information. Systems that process more sensitive information demand a greater degree of control to ensure said information maintains its confidentiality and integrity.

1. Standards applied as presented in this document must consider asset and data sensitivity on a per policy basis. As such, these standards have been composed with consideration to a data-centric approach to sensitivity.

### NIST Security Configuration Checklist Program

Vulnerabilities are discovered daily with exploits being made widely available on the Internet. The National Institute of Standards and Technology provide a basic, effective tool to baseline security controls and policies - the security configuration checklist.

The goals of the NIST Checklist Program are:

1. To facilitate the development and sharing of security configuration checklists by providing a framework for checklist providers/developers to submit checklists to NIST.

1. To assist checklist developers in generating content that conforms to common baseline levels of security.

1. To assist checklist providers/developers and users by providing guidelines for enhancing the documentation and usability of security guidance.

1. To provide a managed process for the review, update, and maintenance of security checklists.

1. To provide checklists in standard XML format as per the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) for use by commercial off-the-‹shelf (COTS) security tools.

1. To provide an easy to use repository of checklists.

### ISO/IEC 27002:2005

ISO/IEC 27002 is an information security standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in conjunction with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC),This standard provides best practice recommendations on information security management for use by those responsible for initiating, implementing or maintaining information security management systems (ISMS). Information security is defined within the standard in the context of the CIA triad:

*"the preservation of confidentiality (ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access), integrity (safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods) and availability (ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated assets when required)."*
