# Developer tools team

**The developer tools team does not yet exist** and currently works as part of the [distribution team](../distribution/index.md).

## Vision

We want to make developing at Sourcegraph a seamless experience and create tools, systems and workflows that empower Sourcegraph engineers to work more efficiently and build quality products.

## Goals

### Automate tasks that slow down development

### Promote the utilization of best practices

### Create and champion common development workflows
