# Hiring

## Tools

The source-of-truth for our open positions is [our careers repository](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers).

We use [Google Hire](https://hire.withgoogle.com/t/sourcegraphcom/hiring/landing/active) for our applicant tracking system (ATS). Google Hire is [being discontinued September 1, 2020](https://support.google.com/hire/answer/9460306) so we are in the process of evaluating alternatives.

## Values and practices

1. We want our hiring process to access all potential qualified candidates.
   - We proactively promote our open positions to many different groups, communities, and networks.
2. We want our hiring process to be fair to all candidates.
   - Our job descriptions use inclusive language.
   - We ask a consistent set of questions to each candidate so that we can objectively measure performance across candidates.
   - There are two interviewers in each interview so that we can better detect and compensate for misunderstandings during the interview and biases in the written feedback after the interview.
   - Interviewers take written notes during the interview so there is an objective record of the interview that can be referenced when making a hiring decision.
   - All interviewers submit written feedback independently before being able to see feedback from other interviewers. Feedback may not be edited after submission.
   - We maintain a consistent hiring [decision process](#decision-making-process) for all candidates.

## Job descriptions

Each job description lists qualifications (requirements) and nice-to-haves. If you are unsure if you meet our qualifications, please apply.

We prefer to avoid listing "years of experience" as a qualification because time is only an indirect measure of what we really care about: skills and maturity.

Our team contains highly motivated and productive members who've joined immediately after high school/university or after 10+ years of working at some of the best companies.

## Decision making process

We review each candidate at each stage of our hiring pipeline (e.g. application, phone screen, interviews, references) to determine if we want to move the candidate to the next stage. Here are some things that we consider:

- Applications
    - Does this candidate meet all qualifications for the role they are applying for?
    - Does this candidate's resume and application effectively communicate their skills, accomplishments, and a genuine interest in Sourcegraph?
    - How do this candidate's skills, accomplishments, and interest in Sourcegraph compare to other candidates or our current team?
    - What makes this candidate's application stand out and excite us about moving forward with interviews?
- Interviews
    - Does this candidate have the skills and experience that we are looking for?
    - How do this candidate's skills, accomplishments, and interest in Sourcegraph compare to other candidates or our current team?
    - What makes us excited about hiring this candidate?

## Sharing interview feedback

We don't share specific reasons or feedback if we [decide](#decision-making-process) not to move forward in our hiring process with a candidate.

It would be nice if we could give feedback like this, but we don't do this today. Why?

- The written feedback that we collect during our interview process is intended for an internal audience. We don't ask our interviewers to spend time and effort packaging their feedback in a way that can be delivered directly to candidates.
- Adequately summarizing all interview feedback for a candidate is challenging and time consuming. We choose to spend our time focusing on delivering developmental feedback to our existing teammates.

If any interviewer is asked by a candidate for interview feedback, they may respond with the following message:

> I understand the desire to receive feedback from our interview process, but unfortunately we are not in a position to give it. Here is some public documentation to that effect: https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/hiring#sharing-interview-feedback.

## Respecting time

Interviewing requires time and effort, both for us and for candidates. If we determine that we won't be moving forward in our hiring process before a candidate has completed all interviews, then we will cancel the remaining interviews to be respectful of both the candidate's and interviewers' time.

## Referrals

If there is someone out there that you would be excited to work with everyday– we encourage you to refer them! 

Perhaps they are a friend or maybe they’re a friend of a friend. Perhaps they’re a former classmate or someone you worked with in the past. Maybe you posted our open roles in your social network and they decided to apply when they saw it. 

We welcome referrals in all forms. However, referrals fall into two categories, depending on how actively you were involved in their decision to apply to Sourcegraph:

* **First-hand referral:** A first-hand referral is someone you have personally had significant interactions with. You have met them and chatted with them on more than one occasion, specifically about opportunities at Sourcegraph. Referral bonus is USD $5,000.

* **Second-hand referral:** A second-hand referral is someone that applied after having seen a job post that you made on social media or in a private group. In this case, they directly submitted an application with no additional communication. Referral bonus is USD $2,500.

For both categories above, 50% of the referral bonus is paid out upon the referral’s start date, and the remaining 50% is paid out upon the referral’s 6-month anniversary. If the referral leaves Sourcegraph before that time, the second bonus payment will not be made. 

(This benefit does not apply to managers or recruiters tasked with hiring for a specific role.)

### How to refer someone

#### Step 1: Go to the [Lever referral portal](https://hire.lever.co/referrals/new) and submit the referral form. Make sure your referral's email address matches the email address they will use in their application. (This will ensure you get the credit for the referral.)

#### Step 2: Ask your referral to visit our [careers page](https://github.com/sourcegraph/careers) and submit their application.

#### Step 3: Ping the scheduling coordinator to confirm their application has been marked as your referral. 

#### Step 4: The scheduling coordinator or hiring manager will set up an intro call with them.

### Your referral and the interview process

Please note, if your referral makes it into the interview process, all feedback and information pertaining to their interviews is sensitive information and will not be dislosed to the referrer or anyone outside of the interview panel.

Also, please do not help them with the interview process in any way (e.g. previewing interview questions with them, reviewing any project work), as that would give them an unfair advantage over other candidates.

If you would like to inquire about the stage your referral is in within the process, you may reach out to the scheduling coordinator or hiring manager and they can provide an update on their current stage.
