# Vacation: flexible time off policy

Flexible Time Off (FTO) allows eligible employees to take personal time away from work for rest and recreation, vacation, medical and other personal appointments, short term illness (less than five days), or other situations.
	
Unless taking time off for a reason that would qualify for an approved leave of absence, eligible employees can use FTO in any increments of time. There are no minimum allowances or maximum limits on FTO; however, requests are subject to review and approval by your manager. Approval will be based on business and operational needs. It is the responsibility of each eligible employee to ensure his or her job performance is not jeopardized and business operations are not affected by his or her FTO.

Employees taking FTO for any reason that qualifies for an approved leave of absence must work with human resources to ensure time off is properly designated. FTO may be used during time off that qualifies for an approved leave of absence up to the following limits (please see human resources with any questions):

* Pregnancy disability leave or other state disability leave (non-short term disability eligible): Up to seven days. If leave is taken on an intermittent basis, up to seven days or 56 hours of FTO may be used to cover the intermittent absences.

* Pregnancy disability leave or other state disability leave (short term disability eligible): Up to seven days to coincide with the California State Disability Insurance (SDI) waiting period.

* Military Leave (all types â€“ under USERRA (or any state equivalent)): Up to seven days.

FTO is not earned or accrued, and there is no payout of FTO upon separation from the Company.


## Calendar protocol
Once employees have discussed their scheduled time off with their managers and received approval, employees must add the dates of their unavailability to the "Not working" shared company calendar.
